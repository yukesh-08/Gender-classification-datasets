## **Crowd Detection and Gender Classification Using Deep Learning*

## *1. Introduction*

Crowd detection and gender classification play a vital role in surveillance, public safety, retail analytics, and intelligent traffic management. This project aims to develop a real-time system that can detect people in a crowd and classify their gender using deep learning techniques. The system combines object detection with facial recognition to analyze human presence in live video streams, providing insights into crowd density and demographic distribution.

## *2. Project Objectives*

The primary goals of this project are:

**Crowd Detection:** Identify and count the number of people present in an area using deep learning-based object detection models.
**Gender Classification:** Analyze detected faces and classify them as male or female using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
**Real-Time Processing:** Optimize the system for fast inference, making it suitable for live surveillance and monitoring applications.
**Scalability:** Ensure the system can be deployed across various environments such as public places, shopping malls, and smart city infrastructures.

## *3. Methodology*

**3.1. Crowd Detection Using YOLO**
The project employs YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection model, for real-time crowd detection.
The YOLO model processes video frames and detects people, drawing bounding boxes around individuals.
This approach enables fast and efficient person detection, making it suitable for real-time applications.

**3.2. Face Extraction and Preprocessing**
Once individuals are detected, the system extracts their faces for gender classification.
Facial detection is performed using OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascades or MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) to isolate faces from detected people.
The extracted face images are resized and normalized before passing them into the gender classification model.

**3.3. Gender Classification Using CNN**
The gender classification model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled datasets of male and female faces.
The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers to classify the gender of each detected face.
The model is loaded from a pre-trained Keras model (gender_model.h5), ensuring high accuracy in classification.

**3.4. Real-Time Inference and Output**
The entire pipeline is optimized for real-time inference.
The final output displays bounding boxes around detected people along with their predicted gender.
The system also logs crowd density and gender distribution for further analysis.

## *4. Technologies Used*

**Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras for building and deploying CNN models.
**Object Detection Model:** YOLOv5 for efficient real-time detection.
**Facial Recognition:** OpenCV for face extraction and preprocessing.
